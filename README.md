This is an implementation of the famous game Tetris. It was an voluntary assignment in my course "Procedural and Object-oriented Programming". The game is implemented in C++, and works without any issues. A video of its performace can be viewed here:

Note: I used the functionality given by my course to link and compile. By using these methods one might run into problems where the executable can't find some of the required SDL2-libraries. For me, i had to go manually into the folder containing the executable, double clicked the executable, then got the error message such as: "The code execution cannot proceed because SDL2_mixer.dll was not found...". The solution was to navigate to \subprojects\sdl2_mixer_windows\bin\", where the SDL2_mixer.dll file was located and manually copy it over to where the executable was located.
